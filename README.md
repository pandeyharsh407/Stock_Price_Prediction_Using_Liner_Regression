## Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression
### About the Dataset -
Welcome to our innovative project focused on "Stock Price Prediction using Enhanced Linear Regression." Our comprehensive dataset comprises approximately 60 features extracted from OHLC, QQQ (Nasdaq-100 ETF), and S&P 500, along with essential technical indicators like Bollinger Bands, Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), Stochastic %K oscillator, and RSI.

To enhance accuracy, we've incorporated lagged features based on previous day price data, acknowledging their influence on future stock prices. Additionally, the dataset contains date features, indicating leap years, month starts or ends, quarter starts or ends, etc.

By leveraging this diverse set of features, we aim to uncover valuable insights for stock market forecasting, ranging from trend analysis to overbought/oversold indications, ultimately empowering investors to make well-informed decisions.

Please note that while our initial dataset dates back to 2020 or 2019, we continuously update our data to ensure the most recent information is utilized for precise predictions. Feel free to integrate the latest CSV file in the input section to further refine our model. Join us on this exciting journey as we redefine stock price prediction using enhanced linear regression.

The dataset used contains various technical indicators and historical price data to predict the stock's future price. The code also includes data visualization to plot the time series of the stock's closing price and the predicted vs. actual prices for the validation set. It provides a starting point for stock price prediction tasks using linear regression, and more advanced techniques can be implemented to improve the model's performance.

Feel free to experiment with different datasets, feature engineering techniques, and other machine learning algorithms to refine and enhance the predictions further. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
